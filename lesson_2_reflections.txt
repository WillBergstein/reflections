What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you set up a space for all your files in a given directory to be commited. You need to give you commits a place to go.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different than the working directory and the repository because it allows files to be in a neither of those two places. The file hasn't yet been committed, but is also being prepared to be committed so it isn't just sitting around unchecked in the repository.
