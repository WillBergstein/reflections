How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It showed me what lines had been added, deleted, or changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will be easier to see the progress that I have made in certain areas and allow me to review the ways in which I completed previous tasks at an earlier stage in the project.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pro ais that you can make a decision on when the changes you have made are relevant enough to commit. Con is that if you forget to commit a major change it is a huge problem.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git saves everhy file so you can view the entirety of a repository at a specific point in time. Google Docs treats each file seperatley because each documents is mostly likely not particulary related all the others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log allows you to view a history of commits and git diff allows you to compare them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Version Control would allow me to test out different ways of doings things on my projects because I know that if I make a mistake I can always just go back and check a previous commit. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git to save my changes and track the developement of my projects.
